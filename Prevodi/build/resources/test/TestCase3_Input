38
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:57,338
The two of you?

39
00:02:57,355 --> 00:03:00,002
- I trust him with my life.
- Yeah, well I don't.

40
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:04,000
So you find someone else,
otherwise, the deal is of, all right?!

41
00:03:15,741 --> 00:03:17,635
All right.

42
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,870
I'll find another guy.

43
00:03:22,548 --> 00:03:23,902
Okay?

44
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:26,706
If..

45
00:03:26,893 --> 00:03:29,911
And I mean if this goes according to plan..

46
00:03:31,126 --> 00:03:32,571
He's got a ring.

47
00:03:32,744 --> 00:03:34,034
You take it!

48
00:03:34,175 --> 00:03:36,584
The ring is very important to him.

49
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:39,379
You might say it's his little friend.

50
00:03:40,138 --> 00:03:41,931
Adios.

51
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:48,515
Fucking tosser!

52
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:43,046
- Hello?
- Happy birthday to you

53
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,670
happy birthday to you

54
00:04:45,738 --> 00:04:48,794

55
00:04:48,901 --> 00:04:51,127
happy birthday to you.

56
00:04:51,203 --> 00:04:52,314
Wow, I'm touched.
